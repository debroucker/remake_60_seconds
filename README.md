# Remake of the " 60 seconds ! "

This project is a remake of the game " 60 seconds ! ". 

I did it in 2018, during my 2nd year of university license. This is a personnal project, and is developed in Python3. This project is finished.

## Rules

You can go on an expedition to recover some food, give food to your family. You have to survive as long as possible.
